      In addition to these activities, Ouray is also within an hours drive from the beautiful mountain towns of 
      Telluride and Silverton, which are definitely worth the visit if you havenâ€™t been before.
      We encourage everyone to visit our facebook group to find like-minded guests and plan an outing together. 
      We have a few things planned in town, but we highly encourage our guest to take advantage of their time in 
      this beautiful part of the state and enjoy some of these great activities.
